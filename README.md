# üöÄ Ways of Working: Engineering Leadership & Product Delivery

Welcome to the "Ways of Working" repository! This space is dedicated to documenting our evolving philosophy and frameworks for effective engineering leadership and product development. Here, you'll find principles, guidelines, and practical approaches designed to help our teams think clearly, build effectively, and deliver meaningful outcomes.

We believe in lightweight, meaningful documentation and embrace the "Docs as Code" approach, ensuring our practices are living, version-controlled, and integrated into our workflows.

## üåü Our Core Philosophy: An Integrative Approach to Engineering Leadership and Delivery

At the heart of our "Ways of Working" is an **integrative philosophy** that synthesizes insights from leading thinkers in leadership, systems engineering, and software architecture. This foundational document, `An-Approach-to-Engineering-Leadership-and-Delivery.md`, outlines *what* matters and *why* these elements are critical for effective engineering.

It focuses on key tenets like:

* **Leading with Context, Not Control:** Emphasising purpose, autonomy, mastery, psychological safety, and sustainability.

* **Architectural Thinking:** Promoting simplicity, modularity, lightweight governance, and an evolutionary approach.

* **Process: Structure Without Bureaucracy:** Advocating for Docs-as-Code, data-informed decisions, and iterative delivery.

* **Teams as Systems:** Organising for flow with stream-aligned, enabling, and platform teams.

* **Outcomes, Not Outputs:** Shifting focus to delivering tangible value for users and the business.

* **Partnering with the Business:** Fostering transparent roadmapping and strategic collaboration.

* **Sustainability, Resilience, and Incident Management:** Building systems and cultures that learn and adapt.

* **Strategy and Portfolio-Level Thinking:** Ensuring engineering efforts scale sustainably.

* **Navigating Inherent Tensions:** Understanding and resolving conflicts between principles for systemic health.

This document serves as our guiding star, providing the philosophical underpinning for all our practical frameworks.

## üåâ Keystone: A Hybrid Delivery Framework for Product Development

`keystone.md` introduces "Keystone," our comprehensive framework designed to navigate the complexities of modern product development, especially for integrated products involving software, firmware, hardware, and mechanical components.

Keystone is a pragmatic synthesis, blending the rigour of the V-model with the adaptability of Agile. It's about finding the "sweet spot" for integrated product development, ensuring predictability and traceability while maintaining agility and responsiveness.

**Key aspects of Keystone include:**

* **The "V with a Wavy Iterative Point":** A visual metaphor illustrating how structured requirements and validation (the "Outer V") frame an agile, iterative core for implementation and detailed verification (the "Wavy Iterative Point").

* **Core Principles:** Operationalising concepts like iterative product evolution, continuous verification, cross-functional collaboration, and adaptive planning.

* **Living Artifacts:** Practical guidance on implementing "Docs as Code" for key documents like Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), Interface Control Documents (ICDs), and Requirements Traceability Matrices (RTMs).

**Note:** The `keystone.md` file is currently a comprehensive outline. As this repository develops, this content will be split into multiple, more focused markdown files for better organisation and maintainability.

## üîÆ Future Content & Evolution

As our "Ways of Working" mature, we plan to expand this repository with more detailed guidance, practical examples, and supporting artifacts. Here's a glimpse of what's on the horizon:

### Detailed Keystone Chapters

Breaking down `keystone.md` into individual, focused markdown files for each chapter, allowing for deeper dives into specific topics. Examples include:

* `keystone/03-foundations-of-hybrid-development.md`

* `keystone/08-managing-living-artifacts.md`

* `keystone/10-keystone-in-practice-software-firmware.md`

* `keystone/11-keystone-for-integrated-products-hardware-mechanical.md`

### Template Examples üìù

Providing concrete, ready-to-use templates for key Keystone artifacts, facilitating consistent and lightweight documentation:

* **Product Vision Document / Vision Brief:** For articulating the "why" and "what" of a product.

* **arc42 Inception Canvas / Project Canvas:** For initial project alignment and scope definition.

* **System-Level Requirements:** Templates for high-level functional, non-functional, safety, and compliance requirements.

* **Detailed Requirements (Software, Firmware, Hardware):** For granular, actionable specifications.

* **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):** To capture and communicate critical architectural choices and their rationale.

* **Requests for Comments (RFCs) / Design Proposals:** For collaborative design and decision-making within iterations.

* **C4 Model Diagrams:** Templates and guidelines for creating Context, Container, Component, and Code diagrams (using Mermaid/PlantUML).

* **arc42 Architecture Communication Canvas:** To plan how architectural information will be shared.

* **Test Plans (High-Level & Detailed):** For structuring verification and validation strategies.

* **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) Snippets:** To ensure end-to-end traceability from requirements to tests.

* **Interface Control Documents (ICDs):** For defining clear interfaces between interconnected components (software, firmware, hardware).

* **Risk Register:** A living document for tracking identified risks, mitigation strategies, and status.

### Specific Process Guides Aligned to Keystone üîÑ

Deeper dives into the practical application of Keystone principles and processes:

* **Iterative Product Evolution:** Guides on structuring and executing iterative cycles for multi-disciplinary teams.
